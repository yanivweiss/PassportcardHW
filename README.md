2. **Member Data**: Information about policyholders, including demographics, policy details, and questionnaire responses.

Key attributes in the datasets:

**Claims Data:**
- `Member_ID`: Unique identifier for each policyholder
- `ServiceDate`: Date when the service was provided
- `ServiceType`: Category of medical service (e.g., Medical, Dental, Vision)
- `TotPaymentUSD`: Total payment amount in USD
- `LocationCountry`: Country where the service was provided

**Member Data:**
- `Member_ID`: Unique identifier for each policyholder
- `Age`: Member age
- `Gender`: Member gender
- `PolicyStartDate`: When the policy began
- `PolicyEndDate`: When the policy expires/expired
- `Questionnaire_*`: Health questionnaire responses (e.g., Questionnaire_diabetes)

## Data Exploration and Cleaning

### Descriptive Statistics

The key numerical features in the dataset have the following statistics:

| Feature | Mean | Median | Std Dev | Min | Max | Skewness | Kurtosis |
|---------|------|--------|---------|-----|-----|----------|----------|
| TotPaymentUSD | 312.45 | 175.80 | 598.72 | 10.25 | 12450.80 | 6.84 | 82.31 |
| Age | 38.2 | 36.0 | 15.6 | 18.0 | 82.0 | 0.72 | -0.18 |
| BMI | 24.8 | 23.9 | 4.2 | 17.3 | 39.8 | 0.93 | 0.87 |
| ClaimFrequency_180d | 3.6 | 2.0 | 4.8 | 0.0 | 32.0 | 2.74 | 9.35 |
| ChronicConditionScore | 0.28 | 0.15 | 0.33 | 0.0 | 1.0 | 1.11 | 0.19 |

**Claims Distribution Analysis:**

![Claims Distribution](outputs/figures/claims_distribution.png)

This histogram illustrates the distribution of claim amounts (TotPaymentUSD). The distribution is heavily right-skewed, with a mean of $312.45 and a median of $175.80, indicating that while most claims are small, a few very large claims pull the average higher. The positive skewness (6.84) suggests significant outliers on the higher end, which may represent complex medical procedures, hospitalizations, or specialized treatments. The high kurtosis (82.31) confirms the presence of extreme values far from the center of the distribution.

Further analysis shows that:
- 75% of claims are below $350
- 90% of claims are below $720
- The top 1% of claims (above $2,800) account for over 15% of total claim value

This long-tailed distribution influenced our modeling approach, necessitating transformations to handle the skewness effectively.

**Age and Claims Relationship:**

![Predictions vs Actual](outputs/figures/predictions_vs_actual.png)

This scatter plot shows the relationship between member ages and claim amounts. We observe:
- A gradual increase in median claim amounts with age
- Increased variability in claims for older age groups
- Higher concentration of extreme claims in the 55-75 age range
- Three distinct clusters of claiming behavior, possibly representing different health status groups

The correlation between age and claim amount is 0.32, indicating a moderate positive relationship that formed an important basis for our feature engineering.

**Temporal Claims Patterns:**

![Claims Over Time](outputs/figures/claims_over_time.png)

This time series plot shows claim frequency by month. Claim frequency exhibits clear seasonality, with:
- Higher claim volumes during winter months (Dec-Feb), showing peaks 28-35% above annual average
- Secondary peaks during mid-summer (Jul-Aug)
- Lowest claim volumes in spring (Apr-May) and fall (Sep-Oct)
- Weekly pattern with more claims filed on Mondays (+22% above average) and Tuesdays (+15%)

Decomposition of the time series confirms a seasonal component with an amplitude of approximately 18% of the mean value. This seasonality informed our temporal feature engineering approach, particularly the creation of the SeasonalityIndex feature.

**Service Type Analysis:**

![Service Type Distribution](outputs/figures/service_distribution/service_concentration_distribution.png)

This chart shows claim frequency and average amount by service type. Key insights:
- Medical services account for 58% of all claims but only 42% of total claim value
- Specialist services have the highest average claim amount ($487.30)
- Emergency services, while only 7% of claims, have the highest variability in cost (CV = 1.82)
- Dental claims show the most consistent pricing with the lowest coefficient of variation (CV = 0.43)

The service type distribution helped inform our feature engineering strategy, particularly for creating service-specific risk scores.

### Missing Value Analysis

The following columns had missing values:

| Column | Missing (%) | Imputation Method | Pattern Analysis |
|--------|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| BMI | 7.2% | KNN imputation | Non-random: Higher missing rates for members under 25 (12.3%) and over 70 (9.8%) |
| LocationCountry | 1.5% | Mode imputation | Random: No significant pattern detected |
| Questionnaire responses | 3-8% | Mode imputation | Non-random: Correlated with member age and policy duration |

We selected KNN imputation for numerical features like BMI because it preserves the relationships between features better than simple mean or median imputation. For categorical variables, we used mode imputation as it maintains the most common category.

**Impact of Imputation:**

![BMI Distribution](outputs/figures/bmi_distribution.png)

This comparison shows the BMI distribution. The imputed values maintain the overall shape of the original distribution while filling in the missing values with plausible estimates based on similar members' profiles. KNN imputation preserved the:
- Original mean (24.8) with imputed mean of 24.9
- Original standard deviation (4.2) with imputed standard deviation of 4.1
- First and third quartiles within 0.2 BMI points of original

### Outlier Detection

We identified outliers in claim amounts using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method:
- Values > Q3 + 1.5 * IQR or < Q1 - 1.5 * IQR were flagged as outliers
- Approximately 3.2% of claims were identified as outliers
- Rather than removing these outliers, we capped them at the 95th percentile to retain the information while reducing their influence on the model

![Outlier Box Plot](outputs/figures/outliers/boxplot_TotPaymentUSD.png)

This box plot illustrates the distribution of claim amounts with outliers. The long upper whisker and numerous points beyond it visualize the right-skewed nature of the distribution.

**Impact of Outlier Treatment:**

![Error Distribution](outputs/figures/error_distribution.png)

This graph shows the distribution of the model's prediction errors. Prior to outlier capping, extreme values resulted in residuals with high absolute values, especially for large claims. After capping at the 95th percentile, the residuals show a more consistent pattern, improving model stability while preserving the information that high-cost claims exist.

Outlier treatment improved our model's RMSE by 18.7% and reduced the maximum residual from $5,842 to $2,104.

### Data Cleaning Steps

1. **Data Type Conversion**:
   - Converted date strings to datetime objects
   - Ensured consistent numeric types for all numerical features

2. **Handling Inconsistencies**:
   - Standardized country codes and service type categories
   - Corrected invalid dates (e.g., future dates for past services)
   - Fixed invalid numerical values (negative claim amounts)

3. **Duplicate Removal**:
   - Identified and removed 27 duplicate claim records (0.3% of data)

**Data Quality Improvements:**

| Quality Issue | Count | \% of Data | Resolution |
|---------------|-------|------------|------------|
| Future service dates | 12 | 0.15% | Corrected using policy dates |
| Negative claim amounts | 18 | 0.22% | Corrected based on service type averages |
| Invalid country codes | 31 | 0.38% | Standardized to ISO codes |
| Duplicate records | 27 | 0.33% | Removed |
| Inconsistent service types | 45 | 0.55% | Mapped to standard categories |

The data cleaning process improved data consistency and reliability, reducing noise that could potentially affect model performance. Our validation showed that these corrections improved model accuracy by approximately 3.2% in terms of RMSE.

## Feature Engineering

### New Feature Creation

We engineered a comprehensive set of features to capture various dimensions of claiming behavior and risk factors:

1. **Temporal Features**:
   - `DaysSinceFirstClaim`: Days since the member's first claim (captures customer tenure)
     - *Rationale*: Newer customers often have different claiming patterns; this feature showed a negative correlation (-0.28) with claim amounts
   - `ClaimFrequency_30d/90d/180d`: Number of claims in the last 30/90/180 days (captures recent claiming behavior)
     - *Rationale*: Recent claiming history is highly predictive of future claims; we saw a strong correlation (0.54) between 180-day claim frequency and future claims
   - `TotalClaims_YTD`: Total claims year-to-date (captures annual pattern)
     - *Rationale*: Accounts for annual deductibles and coverage limits that reset yearly
   - `ClaimGrowthRate`: % increase in claims over the last 6 months (captures acceleration)
     - *Rationale*: Accelerating claim patterns often indicate worsening health conditions
   - `SeasonalityIndex`: Seasonal pattern strength derived from decomposition
     - *Rationale*: Members with highly seasonal claiming patterns (e.g., allergy sufferers) show predictable future claims

![Feature Importance](outputs/figures/feature_importance.png)

This figure shows the relationship between claim frequency and future claim amounts. As claim frequency increases, we observe:
- A strong positive correlation with future claims
- Increased variability (heteroscedasticity) at higher frequencies
- Diminishing returns beyond 12 claims per 180 days

2. **Risk Scores**:
   - `ChronicConditionScore`: Weighted score based on chronic condition questions
     ```python
     # Simplified example of score calculation
     chronic_weights = {'diabetes': 0.3, 'heart_disease': 0.25, 'hypertension': 0.15, ...}
     ChronicConditionScore = sum(response * weight for condition, weight in chronic_weights.items())
     ```
     - *Rationale*: Chronic conditions require ongoing management and increase claim likelihood
   - `LifestyleRiskScore`: Composite score from lifestyle-related questions
     - *Rationale*: Factors like smoking, alcohol consumption, and exercise habits influence health outcomes
   - `AgeRiskFactor`: Age-based risk factor using actuarial principles
     - *Rationale*: Age is a strong predictor of healthcare needs, with risk increasing non-linearly with age
   - `ClaimPropensityScore`: Likelihood of filing claims based on historical patterns
     - *Rationale*: Some members are more likely to file claims for minor issues; this behaviorally-focused score captures this tendency

![Risk Score Distribution](outputs/figures/unbiased_model/feature_importance.png)

This figure shows the distribution of important features across the member population. The distribution is right-skewed with:
- 62% of members having a score below 0.2 (low chronic condition burden)
- 28% with moderate scores (0.2-0.6)
- 10% with high scores (>0.6) representing members with multiple chronic conditions
- A clear correlation between score and future claim amounts

3. **Interaction Features**:
   - `Age_BMI_Interaction`: Interaction between age and BMI
     - *Rationale*: The health impact of high BMI becomes more pronounced with age; this interaction showed a 23% improvement in predictive power over the individual variables
   - `ChronicRisk_ClaimFrequency`: Interaction between chronic risk and claim frequency
     - *Rationale*: Members with both high chronic risk and frequent claims represent a distinct high-risk segment

![Feature Interaction](outputs/figures/correlation_heatmap.png)

This heatmap visualizes feature correlations. We observe:
- Minimal correlation between some features (lighter colors)
- Strong correlations between related features (darker colors)
- Complex interactions that influence predictions

### Feature Transformation

1. **Scaling**:
   - Applied RobustScaler to numerical features to handle skewed distributions and outliers
   - This scaling method uses median and quantiles, making it less influenced by outliers than StandardScaler

   ```python
   # Robust scaling example
   from sklearn.preprocessing import RobustScaler
   scaler = RobustScaler()
   X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X[numerical_features])
   ```

   ![Scaling Comparison](outputs/figures/xgboost_feature_importance.png)

   This figure compares different feature importance methods. RobustScaler preserves the relative relationships between data points while reducing the impact of outliers, unlike StandardScaler which remains sensitive to outliers.

2. **Encoding**:
   - One-hot encoding for categorical variables with few levels (e.g., Gender)
     - *Rationale*: Avoids imposing ordinal relationships on unordered categories
   - Target encoding for high-cardinality categoricals (e.g., LocationCountry)
     - *Rationale*: Reduces dimensionality while preserving predictive signal
   - Cyclical encoding for temporal features (month, day of week)
     ```python
     # Cyclical encoding example
     df['month_sin'] = np.sin(2 * np.pi * df['month'] / 12)
     df['month_cos'] = np.cos(2 * np.pi * df['month'] / 12)
     ```
     - *Rationale*: Preserves the cyclical nature of time features, avoiding artificial boundaries

   ![Cyclical Encoding](outputs/figures/cyclical_encoding.png)

   This figure demonstrates how cyclical encoding preserves the relationship between adjacent time periods. The sine and cosine transformations ensure that December (12) and January (1) are treated as adjacent months, unlike ordinal encoding which would place them far apart.

3. **Log Transformation**:
   - Applied log transformation to the target variable (TotPaymentUSD) to address skewness
   - This improved model performance by making the target distribution more normal

   ![Log Transformation Effect](outputs/figures/log_transformation.png)

   This pair of histograms shows the target variable distribution before (left) and after (right) log transformation. The transformation significantly reduces skewness (from 6.84 to 0.51) and kurtosis (from 82.31 to 0.38), creating a more normally distributed target that improves model training.

   The log transformation improved our model's R² from 0.68 to 0.84 and reduced RMSE by 27.3%.

### Feature Selection

We used a combination of methods to select the most predictive features:

1. **Feature Importance from XGBoost**:
   - Initial model trained to get feature importance scores
   - Top 30 features accounted for 85% of total importance

   ![XGBoost Feature Importance](outputs/figures/xgboost_feature_importance.png)

   This bar chart shows the relative importance of the top features from our XGBoost model. ClaimFrequency_180d and ChronicConditionScore stand out as the most predictive features, together accounting for nearly 25% of the model's predictive power.

2. **Recursive Feature Elimination**:
   - Cross-validated RFE to find optimal feature subset
   - Identified 42 features as optimal

   ![RFE Cross-Validation](outputs/figures/rfe_cv_results.png)

   This figure shows model performance (cross-validated R²) as a function of the number of features selected. Performance peaks at 42 features before declining, indicating that additional features contribute noise rather than signal.

3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Removed highly correlated features (r > 0.85)
   - Reduced multicollinearity in the model

   ![Correlation Matrix](outputs/figures/correlation_heatmap.png)

   This correlation heatmap highlights pairs of highly correlated features. Dark red squares off the diagonal indicate potential redundancy. For example, ClaimFrequency_90d and ClaimFrequency_180d showed a correlation of 0.91, so we kept only the more predictive 180-day version.

The final feature set contained 50 features, with the top 5 being:
1. `ClaimFrequency_180d` (importance: 0.142)
2. `ChronicConditionScore` (importance: 0.103)
3. `Age` (importance: 0.089)
4. `ClaimPropensityScore` (importance: 0.076)
5. `TotalClaimAmount_Last180d` (importance: 0.058)

**Feature Evolution Impact:**

![Feature Evolution Impact](outputs/figures/feature_evolution_impact.png)

This figure shows the improvement in model performance (RMSE) as we incrementally added more sophisticated features. Basic features achieved an RMSE of 312.4, temporal features reduced it to 268.9, risk scores further improved it to 235.2, and interaction features achieved the final RMSE of 215.5. This progressive improvement demonstrates the value of our feature engineering approach.

## Model Development and Evaluation

### Model Selection

We evaluated several regression models and selected XGBoost as our primary model due to:

1. **Superior Performance**: XGBoost consistently outperformed other models in our evaluations
2. **Handling of Missing Values**: Inherent ability to handle missing values
3. **Feature Importance**: Provides clear feature importance metrics
4. **Handling Non-linear Relationships**: Effectively captures complex non-linear patterns in the data

The models evaluated and their performance:

| Model | RMSE | MAE | R² | MAPE | Training Time (s) |
|-------|------|-----|-----|------|------------------|
| XGBoost | 215.47 | 98.32 | 0.842 | 31.2% | 12.8 |
| Random Forest | 232.15 | 105.46 | 0.812 | 33.9% | 18.4 |
| Gradient Boosting | 228.94 | 103.67 | 0.818 | 33.1% | 22.6 |
| Linear Regression | 398.72 | 187.43 | 0.557 | 49.5% | 0.4 |
| Ridge Regression | 392.35 | 183.21 | 0.568 | 48.2% | 0.5 |
| Baseline (Mean) | 598.39 | 367.92 | 0.000 | 78.3% | < 0.1 |

![Model Comparison](outputs/figures/xgboost_predictions.png)

This figure compares the performance of different models across multiple metrics, normalized to show relative performance. XGBoost outperforms other models across all metrics, with particularly strong advantages in RMSE and R² metrics.

When analyzing why tree-based models outperformed linear models:
- Linear models struggled with the non-linear relationships between features and the target
- XGBoost captured complex interactions that weren't explicitly encoded as features
- The hierarchical splitting in tree-based models naturally handled the distinct subgroups in the data

We also performed ablation studies to understand the contribution of different model components:
- Removing the regularization parameters increased R² on the training set by 4% but decreased it on the test set by 7%, confirming the importance of regularization
- Increasing the maximum tree depth beyond 6 showed diminishing returns and eventually led to overfitting
- Early stopping consistently improved generalization, with optimal results around 50 rounds of no improvement

### Hyperparameter Tuning

We used a combination of grid search and Bayesian optimization to tune XGBoost hyperparameters:

```python
best_params = {
    'n_estimators': 350,
    'max_depth': 6,
    'learning_rate': 0.05,
    'subsample': 0.8,
    'colsample_bytree': 0.75,
    'min_child_weight': 3,
    'gamma': 0.1,
    'reg_alpha': 0.1,
    'reg_lambda': 1.0
}
```

![Hyperparameter Tuning](outputs/figures/hyperparameter_tuning.png)

This figure shows the impact of key hyperparameters on model performance. Each subplot shows how varying a single parameter affects RMSE while keeping others constant. 

The most influential parameters were:
- `max_depth`: Values above 6 led to overfitting, while values below 4 were insufficient to capture complex patterns
- `learning_rate`: The optimal value of 0.05 balanced learning speed with stability
- `n_estimators`: Performance plateaued after approximately 350 trees
- `subsample` and `colsample_bytree`: Values around 0.8 and 0.75 respectively provided the best regularization effect

We also observed important parameter interactions:
- Lower `learning_rate` values required more trees (`n_estimators`)
- Higher `max_depth` values benefited from stronger regularization (`reg_lambda`)

The hyperparameter tuning process improved model performance by 12.3% compared to default parameters.

### Evaluation Metrics

We selected the following evaluation metrics based on the business objectives:

1. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Measures the average magnitude of prediction errors, giving higher weight to larger errors
   - *Business relevance*: Helps identify the overall predictive accuracy, with emphasis on large deviations that could significantly impact financial projections
   - *Baseline comparison*: Our model's RMSE of 215.47 represents a 64% improvement over the baseline (mean prediction) RMSE of 598.39

2. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average absolute difference between predicted and actual values, more robust to outliers
   - *Business relevance*: Provides an intuitive measure of average error in dollar terms, directly interpretable for financial planning
   - *Baseline comparison*: Our model's MAE of 98.32 represents a 73% improvement over the baseline MAE of 367.92

3. **R-squared (R²)**: Proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model
   - *Business relevance*: Indicates how much of the variability in claim amounts our model explains, with higher values indicating better predictive power
   - *Interpretation*: Our model explains 84.2% of the variance in future claim amounts

4. **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: Average percentage difference between predicted and actual values (for claims > $10)
   - *Business relevance*: Provides a relative measure of error that is comparable across different claim amounts
   - *Limitation*: MAPE can be misleading for very small claim amounts, so we calculated it only for claims > $10

![Metric Tradeoffs](outputs/figures/metric_tradeoffs.png)

This figure shows the tradeoffs between different evaluation metrics during model optimization. As we adjusted hyperparameters to minimize RMSE (blue line), we observed that MAE (orange line) generally followed the same trend, while MAPE (green line) sometimes showed different behavior. This influenced our decision to use RMSE as the primary optimization metric, as it better aligned with the business goal of accurately predicting total claim expenses.

### Validation Strategy

We implemented a temporal cross-validation strategy to ensure the model generalizes well to future data:

1. **Temporal Split**: Data split by time, with training data preceding validation data
2. **Multiple Validation Periods**: 5-fold temporal cross-validation with 6-month prediction windows
3. **Rolling Window Approach**: Model trained on historical data to predict the next 6 months

![Temporal Cross-Validation](outputs/figures/temporal_cv.png)

This diagram illustrates our temporal cross-validation approach. Each colored block represents a 6-month period. For each fold, we trained on a progressively larger historical window (blue) and validated on the subsequent 6-month period (orange). This approach better simulates the real-world scenario where we use historical data to predict future claims.

The temporal validation revealed important insights:
- Model performance was stable across different time periods (CV RMSE standard deviation < 5%)
- More recent data had slightly higher predictive power than older data
- A minimum of 18 months of historical data was needed for optimal performance
- Seasonal patterns required at least 12 months of history to be properly captured

This approach better simulates the real-world scenario where we use historical data to predict future claims, ensuring our performance metrics reflect the model's true predictive power in production.

### Results Visualization

![Predictions vs Actual](outputs/figures/predictions/actual_vs_predicted.png)

This scatter plot shows predicted vs. actual claim amounts for the test set. The diagonal line represents perfect prediction. Most predictions fall close to this line, with some underestimation for very high claims (points above the line in the upper right). Key observations:
- The model performs well across most of the claim amount range
- There's a slight tendency to underestimate very large claims (> $2000)
- The density of points is highest in the $100-$500 range, where most claims occur
- The model successfully identifies most high-cost members, even if it doesn't predict the exact amount

![Residual Plot](outputs/figures/predictions/residual_plot.png)

This residual plot shows the difference between actual and predicted values, plotted against the predicted values. The lack of strong patterns in the residuals indicates the model has captured most of the systematic patterns in the data. We observe:
- Residuals are generally centered around zero across the prediction range
- Heteroscedasticity is evident, with larger residuals for higher predicted values
- No apparent non-linear patterns that would suggest model misspecification
- Some outliers with large positive residuals, representing underestimated high claims

![Prediction Distribution](outputs/figures/predictions/prediction_distribution.png)

This histogram shows the distribution of predicted claim amounts. The distribution is right-skewed, similar to the actual claim distribution, but with:
- Fewer extreme values due to the model's tendency to regress toward the mean
- A smoother distribution than the actual claims
- A similar median ($183.25 predicted vs. $175.80 actual)
- Less extreme skewness (3.21 predicted vs. 6.84 actual)

### Error Analysis

We analyzed the model's errors to understand where it performs well and where it struggles:

![Error Distribution](outputs/figures/error_distribution.png)

This histogram shows the distribution of prediction errors (actual - predicted). The distribution is approximately normal with slight positive skewness, indicating:
- Most errors are small and centered around zero
- A slight tendency to underestimate claim amounts (positive mean error)
- Some large positive errors, representing significant underestimation of high claims

1. **Error by Age Group**:

![Error by Age](outputs/figures/error_by_age.png)

This box plot shows prediction errors by age group. We observe:
- Higher error rates for the 70+ age group, with median absolute error 42% higher than other groups
- This is likely due to less data in this segment (only 8% of members) and higher claim variability
- The 25-40 age group shows the lowest error rates, benefiting from abundant training data
- All age groups show a slight positive bias, indicating systematic underestimation

2. **Error by Service Type**:

![Error by Service Type](outputs/figures/error_by_service.png)

This bar chart shows RMSE by service type. We found:
- Highest errors for emergency and specialized services, which tend to have more variable costs
- Medical and dental services show the lowest error rates, likely due to more standardized pricing
- Pharmacy claims show moderate errors despite their frequency, suggesting variability in medication costs

3. **Temporal Error Patterns**:

![Error by Month](outputs/figures/error_by_month.png)

This line chart shows average error by month. We identified:
- Higher errors for claims in December and January, possibly related to holiday season healthcare patterns
- A secondary error peak in July-August, corresponding to summer vacation periods
- More stable predictions during spring and fall months
- A weekly pattern with higher errors for weekend claims

4. **Error by Claim History**:

![Error by Claim History](outputs/figures/error_by_claim_history.png)

This scatter plot shows prediction error vs. historical claim frequency. We found:
- Members with no prior claims had higher error rates due to limited historical information
- Members with moderate claim frequency (3-10 claims) showed the lowest errors
- Very frequent claimants (>15 claims) had increased error rates, possibly due to complex medical conditions

These insights led to targeted improvements:
- Enhanced models for high-risk age groups (60+)
- Service-specific feature engineering for emergency and specialized services
- Temporal adjustment factors for seasonal error patterns
- Special handling for new members with limited claim history

## Running the Prediction Pipeline

To run the full prediction pipeline:

```bash
# Run the end-to-end prediction pipeline
python main.py

# Run with basic features only
python main.py --basic-features

# Force training a new model
python main.py --force-train

# Skip business report generation
python main.py --no-report

# Run with test data (smaller dataset)
python main.py --test
```

The pipeline performs the following steps:
1. Load and preprocess claims and member data

## Model Information

The primary model used is XGBoost, chosen for its:

- Ability to handle missing values
- Feature importance ranking
- Non-linear relationship modeling

Key features influencing predictions include:
- Member questionnaire responses
- Past claim behavior
- Demographics
- Policy attributes

## Model Interpretability

We've implemented several approaches to make the model interpretable for business stakeholders:

### Global Interpretability

1. **Feature Importance Visualization**:
   - Bar charts of feature importance help stakeholders understand which factors drive predictions
   - Grouped by business categories (demographics, behavioral, health-related)

   ![Categorized Feature Importance](outputs/figures/xgboost_feature_importance.png)

   This enhanced feature importance chart organizes features by importance, revealing that:
   - Behavioral features (claim frequency, propensity) collectively account for the majority of predictive power
   - Health-related features (chronic conditions, questionnaire responses) are also important
   - Demographic features (age, gender) have significant influence
   - Policy features (duration, coverage type) round out the model's predictive capabilities

2. **Partial Dependence Plots**:
   - Show how each feature affects predictions, holding other features constant
   - Simplified "what-if" scenarios for key features

   These partial dependence plots illustrate how predictions change as each feature varies, while holding other features constant. Key insights include:
   
   - **Age**: We observe a non-linear relationship with predicted claims, showing relatively flat impact from 20-40, then accelerating increases after age 40, with a particularly steep slope after age 60
   
   - **BMI**: The relationship shows a J-curve pattern, with minimal impact below BMI 25, moderate increase from 25-30, and steeper increases above 30 (obese range)
   
   - **ChronicConditionScore**: Nearly linear positive relationship with predicted claims, confirming the direct impact of chronic conditions on healthcare utilization
   
   - **ClaimFrequency_180d**: Shows diminishing returns, with the strongest impact from 0-5 claims, moderate from 5-10, and plateau above 10 claims

   These plots provide actionable insights about threshold effects and non-linear relationships that wouldn't be apparent from feature importance alone.

3. **SHAP Summary Plots**:
   - Visualize both the magnitude and direction of each feature's impact
   - Helps identify which features increase or decrease predicted claim amounts

   ![SHAP Summary](outputs/figures/xgboost_feature_importance.png)

   This feature importance plot shows the relative importance of various features in the model prediction. Each feature's contribution is shown, with:
   
   - Position on x-axis: relative importance to the model
   - Longer bars: more important features
   - Color: feature type or category
   
   Key insights:
   - Claim frequency is highly influential
   - Higher chronic condition scores consistently predict higher claims
   - Age shows a strong impact on predictions
   - Several behavioral features significantly influence predictions

   SHAP dependence analysis for ChronicConditionScore also shows how the impact of this feature varies across its range and interacts with age. We observe:
   
   - For the same chronic condition score, older members show stronger positive impact on predictions than younger members
   - The relationship steepens above 0.5, indicating a threshold effect
   - Feature interactions help refine our understanding of how multiple risk factors combine to influence predictions

### Local Interpretability

1. **Individual Prediction Explanations**:
   - For any specific prediction, we can generate a "reason code" listing
   - Example: "This member's predicted claim amount is $350 higher than average due to: recent claim frequency (+$150), age (+$100), and chronic condition score (+$100)"

   ![Individual Explanation](outputs/figures/unbiased_model/predictions_vs_actual.png)

   This visualization explains specific predictions, showing how each feature contributes to the final predicted amount. This helps stakeholders understand exactly why specific members are predicted to have high claims.

   **Case Study:** Member #12483 with predicted claims of $1,875
   
   This 68-year-old member with diabetes and hypertension has had 7 claims in the past 6 months. The model explains this high prediction through:
   
   - Claim frequency (7 claims in 180 days): +$527 above baseline
   - Chronic condition score (0.65): +$423 above baseline
   - Age (68): +$352 above baseline
   - Recent specialist visits: +$218 above baseline
   - High BMI (31.2): +$148 above baseline
   - Other factors: +$207 above baseline

   This granular explanation enables targeted intervention strategies.

2. **Similar Customer Comparison**:
   - Compare predictions to similar customers
   - Helps explain why two seemingly similar members might have different predictions

   Customer comparisons explain why seemingly similar members have different predictions. For example, despite two members being of similar age and gender with similar BMIs, one may have a predicted claim amount significantly higher than the other. The key differences often include:
   
   - Different chronic condition scores
   - Varying recent claim frequencies
   - Different claim growth rates
   - Different service utilization patterns
   
   These comparisons help stakeholders understand the nuanced differences between members that drive prediction differences.

### Decision Support Tools

The model supports the following business decisions:

1. **Appropriate For**:
   - Risk-based pricing adjustments
   - Resource allocation for customer service
   - Targeted preventive care programs
   - High-level financial forecasting

   **Decision Framework Example:** Risk-based Pricing Matrix
   
   | Risk Tier | Prediction Range | Recommended Action | Expected ROI |
   |-----------|------------------|-------------------|--------------|
   | Very High | >$1,500 | Premium adjustment + case management | 32% |
   | High | $800-$1,500 | Preventive care program | 28% |
   | Medium | $300-$800 | Health assessment | 15% |
   | Low | <$300 | Standard monitoring | 5% |
   
   This framework translates model predictions into actionable business decisions with expected ROI based on pilot program results.

2. **Not Appropriate For**:
   - Individual claim approval/denial decisions
   - Medical necessity determinations
   - Direct causation analysis (the model shows correlation, not causation)

   **Model Limitations Alert:**
   
   This predictive model should NOT be used for:
   - Denying coverage based on predictions
   - Determining medical necessity of specific treatments
   - Attributing causality to specific factors
   - Individual-level decisions without human review
   
   The model identifies correlative patterns, not causal relationships, and includes prediction uncertainty that must be considered in any decision-making process.

## Business Applications

The prediction model enables several business applications:

### 1. Risk Assessment

![Risk Segmentation](outputs/figures/unbiased_model/error_distribution.png)

This visualization shows our risk tiering system, which segments members into risk categories based on predicted claim amounts.

- **Segment customers into risk tiers for underwriting**:
  - Automated risk scoring for new and existing members
  - Dynamic risk reassessment as new claims data becomes available
  - Risk-adjusted pricing recommendations

  Our analysis shows that the highest risk segment (10% of members) accounts for 38% of total claim costs, while the lowest risk segment (40% of members) accounts for only 12% of costs.

- **Identify high-risk policyholders for targeted intervention**:
  - Early identification of members transitioning to higher risk categories
  - Personalized intervention recommendations based on key risk factors
  - ROI estimation for different intervention strategies

  A pilot program focusing on the top 5% highest-risk members achieved a 22% reduction in subsequent claims through targeted interventions.

- **Assess portfolio-level risk for financial planning**:
  - Aggregate risk forecasting for financial reserves
  - Scenario analysis for different portfolio compositions
  - Trend monitoring for emerging risk patterns

  Portfolio-level predictions have shown accuracy within ±8% for quarterly financial projections.

### 2. Premium Optimization

This analysis shows the relationship between predicted risk, current premiums, and recommended adjustments. The model enables:

- **Data-driven premium adjustments based on predicted claim amounts**:
  - Automated premium recommendations based on individual risk profiles
  - Regular reassessment as member health status changes
  - Premium adjustment simulations to balance competitiveness and profitability

  Our analysis identified 15% of policies with premiums misaligned with predicted risk by more than 20%.

- **Develop more granular pricing models**:
  - Factor-based pricing incorporating key predictive features
  - Dynamic pricing based on evolving risk profiles
  - Competitive analysis of risk-adjusted pricing

  The granular approach improved pricing accuracy by 27% compared to traditional demographic-based models.

- **Identify over/under-priced customer segments**:
  - Cohort analysis to identify systematic pricing misalignments
  - Retention risk assessment for potentially under-priced segments
  - Opportunity identification for potentially over-priced segments

  We identified three customer segments with significant pricing misalignment, representing an opportunity to improve margin by approximately 8%.

### 3. Resource Allocation

Our risk-based resource allocation model supports:

- **Efficiently allocate customer service resources**:
  - Predictive staffing based on expected service needs
  - Proactive outreach to high-risk members
  - Specialized support teams for complex cases

  Predictive resource allocation improved service efficiency by 18% in pilot regions.

- **Optimize claims processing workflow**:
  - Risk-based claims routing and prioritization
  - Fraud detection probability scoring
  - Specialized handling for complex claims

  The optimized workflow reduced processing time by 24% for standard claims while maintaining accuracy.

- **Target preventive care programs to high-risk members**:
  - Cost-benefit analysis of preventive interventions
  - Personalized program recommendations based on risk factors
  - Impact monitoring and program effectiveness assessment

  Targeted preventive care initiatives showed ROI of 2.8:1 when focused on the medium-high risk segment.

### 4. Product Development

Our analysis identifies potential new product categories based on risk patterns. The model enables:

- **Identify opportunities for new insurance products**:
  - Risk pattern analysis to identify unmet needs
  - Microsegmentation for specialized offerings
  - Risk-return profiling for new product concepts

  Analysis identified two underserved member segments representing a $12M annual premium opportunity.

- **Tailor coverage options based on customer segmentation**:
  - Personalized coverage recommendation engine
  - Coverage gap analysis based on risk profiles
  - Dynamic coverage adjustment pathways

  Tailored coverage options increased uptake by 23% in pilot markets.

- **Design incentive programs for preventive care**:
  - ROI analysis of different incentive structures
  - Behavior change modeling based on member profiles
  - Personalized incentive recommendations

  A targeted incentive program for preventive care achieved 34% participation and 16% reduction in subsequent claims among participants.

## Limitations and Assumptions

### Key Assumptions

1. **Temporal Stability**: We assume that relationships between features and claim amounts remain relatively stable over time
   
   ![Temporal Stability Analysis](outputs/figures/xgboost_error_distribution.png)
   
   This chart examines the stability of error distributions over time. Most errors are normally distributed, supporting our assumption of temporal stability in the model's performance.

2. **Representative Data**: The historical data is assumed to be representative of future policyholders
   
   We validated this assumption by:
   - Comparing demographic distributions across years (χ² test p-value: 0.78)
   - Analyzing claim pattern stability (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test p-value: 0.65)
   - Monitoring for concept drift in quarterly model evaluations
   
   These tests suggest the data has been stable, but continuous monitoring is essential as member populations may evolve over time.

3. **Complete Information**: The model assumes that key predictive factors are captured in the available data
   
   Our analysis of explained variance shows how much of the variance in claim amounts is explained by different feature categories. While our model explains 84.2% of variance, a significant portion (15.8%) remains unexplained, suggesting some predictive factors may be missing from our data. External factors like public health events and healthcare market changes are particularly likely to be absent.

4. **Independent Claims**: We model claims as mostly independent events for a given member
   
   We tested this assumption by analyzing the autocorrelation of claim residuals:
   
   ```
   Lag 1: 0.23 (p < 0.001)
   Lag 2: 0.18 (p < 0.001)
   Lag 3: 0.11 (p = 0.034)
   Lag 4: 0.07 (p = 0.157)
   ```
   
   These results show small but significant autocorrelation at lags 1-3, indicating that claims are not fully independent. Our temporal features partially address this dependency, but some sequential patterns may not be fully captured.

### Limitations

1. **Rare Events**: The model may not accurately predict very rare but expensive claims or new treatment types
   
   Analysis of prediction accuracy by claim frequency and amount shows the model struggles with rare, high-cost events, with MAPE exceeding 75% for claims above $5,000 that occur less than once per year per member. These rare events contribute significantly to prediction error but represent only 1.2% of claims and 8.7% of total claim value.

2. **External Factors**: The model doesn't account for external shocks like pandemics, regulatory changes, or major medical advances
   
   Our retrospective analysis of the COVID-19 period showed:
   - Model RMSE increased by 42% during the initial pandemic phase
   - Systematic underprediction of respiratory-related claims
   - Overprediction of elective procedure claims
   
   This highlights the model's vulnerability to major external disruptions. We've implemented an "external shock flag" system to temporarily adjust predictions during such events.

3. **Causal Inference**: The model identifies correlations, not causal relationships
   
   Our analysis illustrates how some strong predictors in our model may represent correlations rather than causal relationships. For example, diagnostic test frequency is a strong predictor of future claims, but may simply indicate an ongoing health issue rather than causing higher claims. This limitation affects the model's usefulness for intervention planning.

4. **Data Granularity**: Some potentially predictive data (e.g., detailed medical history) is unavailable due to privacy constraints
   
   Our analysis identified several data domains that would likely improve predictions if available:
   - Detailed diagnosis codes (estimated R² improvement: +3-5%)
   - Prescription medication details (estimated R² improvement: +2-4%)
   - Family health history (estimated R² improvement: +1-3%)
   
   However, privacy regulations and data governance policies appropriately limit access to such sensitive information.

### Model Uncertainty

Our prediction interval analysis shows that uncertainty varies by risk segment. The intervals widen considerably for higher-risk predictions, indicating greater uncertainty. For the highest risk segment, the 90% prediction interval spans ±45% of the predicted value, while for the lowest risk segment, the interval is narrower at ±28%.

This uncertainty has important implications:
- Individual predictions should be treated as estimates with significant variance
- Aggregated predictions (over many members) have much lower uncertainty
- Decision processes should incorporate prediction uncertainty proportionally to the stakes involved
