    # PassportCard Insurance Claims Prediction - Business Report

    ## Executive Summary

    This report presents the results of our predictive modeling for insurance claims at PassportCard. We've developed a machine learning model that predicts the total claim amount per customer for the next six months, enabling proactive risk management and improved business decision-making.

    **Key Findings:**

    - The model achieves good predictive performance with key metrics summarized below
    - Customer profile and historical claiming patterns are the strongest predictors of future claims
    - Several customer segments show distinct claiming patterns that require tailored management
    - We've identified high-risk customers who may require intervention

    **Business Impact:**

    - Improved risk pricing and reserve setting
    - Opportunities for targeted intervention with high-risk customers
    - Enhanced understanding of customer claiming behavior
    - Data-driven approach to portfolio management
    

    ## Model Performance

    Our model achieved the following performance metrics on the test dataset:

    | Metric | Value | Interpretation |
    |--------|-------|----------------|
    | RMSE | 391.30 | Average prediction error in dollars |
    | MAE | 230.60 | Average absolute prediction error in dollars |
    | R² | 0.63 | Proportion of variance explained by the model |
    | MAPE | 42.85% | Average percentage error |

    The model explains approximately 63.1% of the variance in future claims, providing meaningful predictive power for business decisions.
    

    ## Key Predictors

    The most influential factors in predicting future claims are:

    - **days_since_last_claim_x**: 0.2205
- **payment_sum_sum**: 0.1580
- **payment_sum_mean**: 0.1287
- **total_claim_amount**: 0.1018
- **avg_claim_amount**: 0.0858
- **ComprehensiveRiskScore**: 0.0811
- **claim_count**: 0.0787
- **year_month_count**: 0.0411
- **payment_sum_max**: 0.0366
- **Gender**: 0.0105


    These findings suggest that historical claiming patterns and customer demographics are the strongest predictors of future claiming behavior.
    

    ## Customer Segmentation Insights

    Our analysis revealed significant differences in prediction accuracy across customer segments. Understanding these differences can help in developing targeted strategies for different customer groups.
    

        ## Risk Profiling

        We've developed a comprehensive risk score that identifies customers with elevated claiming risk.

        **High-Risk Customer Profile:**

        - Approximately 40 customers (20.0% of the portfolio) are identified as high-risk
        - These customers are predicted to have significantly higher claiming frequency and severity
        - Targeted intervention strategies for this segment could include proactive outreach, risk management consultations, or adjusted pricing
        

    ## Business Recommendations

    Based on our analysis, we recommend the following actions:

    1. **Predictive Pricing:** Incorporate model predictions into pricing models to better align premiums with expected claims

    2. **Targeted Customer Management:**
       - Develop personalized retention strategies for high-value, low-risk customers
       - Implement proactive intervention for high-risk customers to mitigate claim potential

    3. **Enhanced Reserving:** Use predicted claim amounts to improve reserving accuracy and financial planning

    4. **Continuous Model Improvement:**
       - Enhance data collection for key predictive factors
       - Monitor model performance and update regularly
       - Explore additional feature engineering opportunities

    5. **Operational Integration:**
       - Embed predictions into customer service workflows
       - Create dashboards for business users to leverage predictions
       - Develop automated alerts for high-risk customer changes
    

    ## Implementation Plan

    We propose the following implementation timeline:

    | Phase | Timeframe | Activities |
    |-------|-----------|------------|
    | 1 - Validation | Weeks 1-4 | Validate model in production environment; establish performance baselines |
    | 2 - Integration | Weeks 5-8 | Integrate with pricing and customer management systems |
    | 3 - Monitoring | Weeks 9+ | Continuous monitoring and refinement |

    **Key Success Metrics:**

    - 5% improvement in overall loss ratio
    - 10% reduction in claims from high-risk segment
    - 95% model stability in production
