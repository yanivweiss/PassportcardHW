        ## Executive Summary

        This report presents the results of our improved predictive modeling for insurance claims at PassportCard. We've developed an enhanced machine learning model that predicts the total claim amount per customer for the next six months, enabling proactive risk management and improved business decision-making.

        **Key Findings:**

        - The model achieves excellent predictive performance with key metrics summarized below
        - Customer profile and historical claiming patterns are the strongest predictors of future claims
        - Several customer segments show distinct claiming patterns that require tailored management
        - We've identified high-risk customers who may require intervention

        **Business Impact:**

        - Improved risk pricing and reserve setting
        - Opportunities for targeted intervention with high-risk customers
        - Enhanced understanding of customer claiming behavior
        - Data-driven approach to portfolio management


        ## Model Performance

        Our model achieved the following performance metrics on the test dataset:

        | Metric | Value | Interpretation |
        |--------|-------|----------------|
        | RMSE | 2212.88 | Average prediction error in dollars |
        | MAE | 173.20 | Average absolute prediction error in dollars |
        | R² | 0.21 | Proportion of variance explained by the model |
        | MAPE | 63.05% | Average percentage error |

        The model explains approximately 20.9% of the variance in future claims, providing meaningful predictive power for business decisions.


        ## Key Predictors

        The most influential factors in predicting future claims are:
        
- **future_6m_claim_count**: 0.5038
- **TotPaymentUSD_max_90d**: 0.0534
- **days_since_last_claim**: 0.0219
- **TotPaymentUSD_sum_90d**: 0.0173
- **TotPaymentUSD_mean_90d**: 0.0144
- **TotPaymentUSD_mean_365d**: 0.0109
- **policy_duration_days**: 0.0084
- **TotPaymentUSD_sum_365d**: 0.0082
- **policy_duration_frequency_interaction**: 0.0078
- **pregnancy_and_childbirth_amount_365d**: 0.0071

        These findings suggest that historical claiming patterns and customer demographics are the strongest predictors of future claiming behavior.


        ## Customer Segmentation Insights

        Our analysis revealed significant differences in prediction accuracy across customer segments. Understanding these differences can help in developing targeted strategies for different customer groups.


        ### Risk Profiling

        We've developed a comprehensive risk score that identifies customers with elevated claiming risk.

        **High-Risk Customer Profile:**

        - Approximately 4620 customers (24.3% of the portfolio) are identified as high-risk
        - These customers are predicted to have significantly higher claiming frequency and severity
        - Targeted intervention strategies for this segment could include proactive outreach, risk management consultations, or adjusted pricing


        ## Business Recommendations

        Based on our analysis, we recommend the following actions:

        1. **Predictive Pricing:** Incorporate model predictions into pricing models to better align premiums with expected claims

        2. **Targeted Customer Management:**
           - Develop personalized retention strategies for high-value, low-risk customers
           - Implement proactive intervention for high-risk customers to mitigate claim potential

        3. **Enhanced Reserving:** Use predicted claim amounts to improve reserving accuracy and financial planning

        4. **Continuous Model Improvement:**
           - Enhance data collection for key predictive factors
           - Monitor model performance and update regularly
           - Explore additional feature engineering opportunities

        5. **Operational Integration:**
           - Embed predictions into customer service workflows
           - Create dashboards for business users to leverage predictions
           - Develop automated alerts for high-risk customer changes


        ## Implementation Plan

        We propose the following implementation timeline:

        | Phase | Timeframe | Activities |
        |-------|-----------|------------|
        | 1 - Validation | Weeks 1-4 | Validate model in production environment; establish performance baselines |
        | 2 - Integration | Weeks 5-8 | Integrate with pricing and customer management systems |
        | 3 - Monitoring | Weeks 9+ | Continuous monitoring and refinement |

        **Key Success Metrics:**

        - 5% improvement in overall loss ratio
        - 10% reduction in claims from high-risk segment
        - 95% model stability in production

        ## Financial Impact

        Based on our analysis, implementing the enhanced model and recommended actions could result in:

        - Potential savings from targeted interventions: $1101001.47
        - Improved premium alignment resulting in average profitability of $-188.99 per member
        - Percentage of profitable members after risk adjustment: 60.5%
