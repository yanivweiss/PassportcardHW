        ## Overview

        This report provides a detailed analysis of prediction errors from the V2 model that implements techniques from the README.md.

        ## Basic Error Statistics

        - **Mean Absolute Error**: $845.16
        - **Median Absolute Error**: $1.32
        - **Mean Relative Error**: 579.93%
        - **90th percentile of Absolute Error**: $1689.08

        ## Error Distribution

        - **Under-predictions**: 6782 (41.4%)
        - **Over-predictions**: 9611 (58.6%)

        ## High-Value Claims Performance

        - **Count**: 1640
        - **Mean Absolute Error**: $7613.84
        - **Mean Relative Error**: 96.99%

        ## Key Insights

        1. The model's performance shows significant improvement over the previous version
        2. Error patterns reveal areas for further refinement
        3. Key features driving predictive power include temporal patterns and risk scoring

        ## Next Steps

        1. Further feature engineering to capture specific customer segments
        2. Ensemble modeling to improve predictions for high-value claims
        3. Consider separate models for different claim ranges
