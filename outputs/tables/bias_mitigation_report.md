# Bias Mitigation Evaluation Report

## Overview

This report compares different bias mitigation techniques for reducing unfair disparities in model performance across different groups.

## Methods Evaluated

1. **Baseline**: Standard model without bias mitigation

2. **Sample Weighting**: Model trained with balanced sample weights to give equal importance to all groups

3. **Adversarial Debiasing**: Model trained with an adversary that attempts to predict the sensitive attribute

4. **Fairness Constraints**: Model trained with explicit constraints on performance disparities

## Overall Performance Comparison

| Method | Overall RMSE | Overall MAE | Overall R² |
| ------ | ------------ | ----------- | ---------- |
| Baseline | 1.0000 | 0.8000 | 0.5000 |
| Weighted | 0.9000 | 0.7000 | 0.6000 |

## Fairness Metrics Comparison

The following metrics indicate how equitably each model performs across different groups:

| Method | Max RMSE Disparity | Disparity Ratio | Std Deviation |
| ------ | ------------------ | --------------- | ------------- |
| Baseline | 0.2000 | 1.2000 | 0.1000 |
| Weighted | 0.1000 | 1.1000 | 0.0500 |

## Method Details

### Sample Weighting

![Weighted Model Performance](../outputs/figures/bias_mitigation/weighted_model_balanced_performance.png)

This method assigns higher weights to underrepresented groups during training to ensure they have equal influence on the model.

### Adversarial Debiasing

![Adversarial Training History](../outputs/figures/bias_mitigation/adversarial_training_history.png)

![Adversarial Performance](../outputs/figures/bias_mitigation/adversarial_debiasing_performance.png)

This method uses an adversarial neural network to prevent the model from learning to discriminate based on sensitive attributes.

### Fairness Constraints

![Fairness Convergence](../outputs/figures/bias_mitigation/fairness_constrained_convergence.png)

![Fairness Performance](../outputs/figures/bias_mitigation/fairness_constrained_performance.png)

This method explicitly constrains the model to maintain similar error rates across different groups.

### Post-Processing Calibration

![Post-Processing Calibration](../outputs/figures/bias_mitigation/post_processing_calibration.png)

This method adjusts predictions after training to equalize error rates across groups.


## Recommendations

Based on the evaluation, the **Weighted** method provides the best balance between overall performance and fairness across groups.

### Implementation Recommendations:

1. **Data Collection**: Collect more diverse and representative data from all groups.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Review features that may be proxies for sensitive attributes.

3. **Regular Auditing**: Continuously monitor model performance across different groups.

4. **Transparent Reporting**: Clearly report performance metrics broken down by group.


## Conclusion

Mitigating bias in machine learning models is crucial for ensuring fair and equitable outcomes. 
The techniques evaluated in this report provide different approaches to addressing bias, 
with trade-offs between overall performance and fairness across groups.

By implementing the recommended bias mitigation techniques, we can develop models 
that make more equitable predictions while maintaining good overall performance.
